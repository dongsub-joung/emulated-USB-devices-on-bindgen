## some text to USB devices

uinput to have a userspace program virtualize input devices.

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to have a userspace program provide a filesystem

The PTY (Pseudo TTY) system that powers terminal emulators by providing virtualized equivalents to the /dev/tty* modes PySerial connects to. (It basically is the important parts of the kernel's serial device driver reused. I recommend The TTY demystified for anyone dealing with serial on Linux.)
